# Burgers Project
	//In this project a client can order 3 different hamburgers:
	//a) Base Burger have the following items: 
		- dry bread roll 
		- chicken meat 
		- up to 4 additional additions (things like salad, tomato, carrot, etc) that the client can select to be added to the burger	
	//b) Deluxe hamburger contains: 
		- normal bread 
		- beaf meat
		- chips and drinks as additions, but NO extra additions are allowed
	//c) Healthy Hamburger contains:
		- brown rye bread roll
		- cheese instead of meat
		- all 4 additional additions from Base Burger plus 2 addition items that can be added
	// So the healthy burger can have 6 items (Additions) in total.
	// Each Hamburger has a base price, without any additional items.
	// Each one of these items gets charged an additional price so I figured out how many items got added and to calculate the final price (specific burger with all the additions).
	// The project starts running from main.
       	 
	
# Mobile Phone Project
	// In this project I simulate a small interaction between a Contact mobile phone application and the User.
	// From application you can: - exit
				     - print existing contacts
				     - add a new contact
				     - update an existing contact
				     - remove an existing contact
				     - query in an existing contact exists
				     - print the list of available actions
        // The application starts every time with 0 contacts.
	// The project starts running from main.
	
	
# PlayList Project
	// This project simulate a playlist which has some songs from 2 different albums ("Stormbringer" from Deep Purple and "For those about to rock" from AC/DC).
	// The application starts by playing the first song from the playlist.
	// I created a menu, as well, so the user can: - shutdown the app
						       - play next song
						       - play previous song
						       - replay te current song
						       - print the playlist
						       - delete current song from playlist
						       - print the menu app
	// The project starts running from main.
