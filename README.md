# Burgers Project
	//In this project I created 3 different hamburgers
	//a) Base Burger have the following items: 
		- dry bread roll 
		- chicken meat 
		- up to 4 additional additions (things like salad, tomato, carrot, etc) that the client can select to be added to the burger	
	//b) Deluxe hamburger contains: 
		- normal bread 
		- beaf meat
		- chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed
	//c) Healthy Hamburger contains:
		- brown rye bread roll
		- cheese instead of meat
		- all 4 additional additions from Base Burger plus 2 addition items that can be added
	// So the healthy burger can have 6 items (Additions) in total.
	// Each one of these items gets charged an additional price so I figured out how many items got added and to calculate the final price (specific burger with all the additions).

	// From application you can: - exit
				     - print existing contacts
				     - add a new contact
				     - update an existing contact
				     - remove an existing contact
				     - query in an existing contact exists
				     - print the list of available actions
